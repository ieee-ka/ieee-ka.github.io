We are happy to announce our next Science Spotlight titled `Science Spotlight: Medical Engineering`. This event will be hosted in conjunction with the kickoff for our local student paper contest.

We will host this event on **July 25th** at the FZI House of Living Labs **Haid-und-Neu-Straße, 76131 Karlsruhe** starting at **16:00**.

We have a preliminary agenda assembled:

**Kick-Off Local Student Paper Contest**

We will start at 16:00 with a short introduction into the idea and the rules for the student paper contest.
If you are interested in participating in the student paper contest we recommend you attend this presentation and also you
can stay after the event and we will try to answer any open questions.


**FZI Presentations (Oliver Werthwein M.Sc. & Lara Schweickart M.Sc.)**

Following the kick-off of the local student paper contest we will have two short presentations about the medical engineering research conducted at FZI.
One presentation will cover the use of AI for analysis and assessment of physical exercises and another presentation will give as an introduction to virtual patient round and contactless recogniction of skin changes in the context of telemedicine.


**FZI House of Living Labs - Tour**

For an entertaining break in-between presentations we are happy that the FZI will give a tour through their House of Living Labs, showing more of their research in the field of medical engineering. This will include parts of the previously presented topics. We are excited to get a nice insight into the work at FZI House of Living Labs.


**Presentation by CEO of corvolution GmbH (Dr. Silvester Fuhrhop)**

Our presenter will give as an insight into the work done at the Start-Up corvolution on the topic of developing algorithms and sensor for long-term monitoring of a range of vital signs.

We will provide cold drinks and snacks for all participants and to allow for some cozy Get-Together after the presentations.

We are happy to announce or first Science Spotlight event focusing on varied research on Machine Learning in different areas of engineering.
The Science Spotlight will take place on the **20th of March 2023** at the Communication Engineering Lab (CEL), **room 213/214 in building 06.45 at the campus west**, starting at **16:00**. We welcome all students, researchers and IEEE members that are interested in the topics.

We have planned three presentations and one demostration:

AI-Native Wireless: Transforming Wireless Design with Deep Learning (Ass. Prof. Tim O'Shea Ph.D.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past decade, deep learning has revolutionized signal processing in fields like speech, language, and vision. But it's also transforming the world of wireless signal transmission quickly. In this talk, we'll explore how data-driven approaches are used to design machine learning-based radio signal detection, identification, and localization. We'll also discuss how machine learning is being used to create signal transmitters, receivers, and encodings for wireless signals. This exciting area of research has already yielded some impressive prototypes and results and is sure to play a significant role in the future of OpenRAN 5G, 5G Advanced, and 6G wireless systems. Join us to learn more about the software challenges and research trends in this field, and how AI-native communications create disruption.

Bibliography
------------
Meet Tim O'Shea - CTO and Co-Founder at DeepSig Inc, and a Research Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech. He's passionate about using machine learning and data-driven approaches to improve wireless physical layer performance and intelligence. With previous experience at wireless startups Hawkeye 360 and Federated Wireless, and as an R&D engineer with USG and Cisco Systems, Tim has authored over 100 academic works and patents in this field. His involvement in IEEE COMSOC, IEEE MLC ETI, Next-G Alliance, and OpenRAN initiatives highlights his involvement in accelerating adoption of AI-driven communication systems technology.



Policy Learning for Robotics (Prof. Dr. Gerhard Neumann)
---------------------------------------------------------
Machine learning, robotics and human-robot interaction pose multiple interesting research questions. We will dive into how human non-expert can intuitively teach a robot complex skills as well as allow a robot to learn how to assist and collaborate with humans in an intelligent way.


Developing Neuromorphic Systems (Brian Pachideh M.Sc., & Alexandru Vasilache M.Sc.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our colleaugues at FZI design systems that differ from the classical artificial neural networks and will present us challenges and advantages of designing systems closer corresponding to the biological inspiration that seeding the research into neural networks. 


TLDR; The Science Spotlight is taking place on the 20.03.2023 starting at 16:00 in room 213/214 at the Communication Engineering Lab (CEL) in building 06.45 at Hertzstraße 16, 76187 Karlsruhe (KIT Campus West). There will be snacks, there will be drinks and hopefully lots of interesting discussion. Anyone interested is invited.
