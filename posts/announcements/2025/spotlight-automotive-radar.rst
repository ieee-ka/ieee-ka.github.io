Some time has passed since our last Science Spotlight. Therefore we are delighted to host another event in cooperation with the IHE. Martin Kunert will give insights into the history and current trend in automotive radar technology.  

This Science Spotlight will take place on the **23rd of January 2025** at the **NTI lecture hall** starting at **15:45**.
We welcome all students, researchers and IEEE members that are interested in the topics. Will provide cold drinks after the event, so you will have the chance to chat with us and the speaker.
