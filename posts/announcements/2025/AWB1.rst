Happy new Year everyone. We are starting strong into 2025 with an AWB (After-work-beer) to network, relax and plan for our 2025 events. 

We will meet **21st of January 2025** at the **KÃ¼hler Krug** starting at **18:30**.
We welcome all students, researchers and IEEE members that are interested to join.
