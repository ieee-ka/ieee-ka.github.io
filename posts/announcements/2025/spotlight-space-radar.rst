We are delighted to host another science spotlight in cooperation with the IHE. The talk is given by radar system engineers Ulrich Steinbrecher and Markus Bachmann from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), who designed and operate the TerraSAR-X & TanDEM-X radar missions. Both satellites have been in orbit for almost 18 years supporting geoscience and environmental monitoring.

Experience the daily work and perspectives of Electrical Engineers in satellite research and learn how radar interferometry is used to generate a digital elevation model. 

This Science Spotlight will take place on the **13th of February 2025** at the **NTI lecture hall** starting at **15:45**.
We welcome all students, researchers and IEEE members that are interested in the topics. Will provide cold drinks and some pizza after the event, so you will have the chance to chat with us and the speakers.

For a more comprehensive description, go to the announcement of `IHE <https://www.ihe.kit.edu/3682_5936.php>`_.
