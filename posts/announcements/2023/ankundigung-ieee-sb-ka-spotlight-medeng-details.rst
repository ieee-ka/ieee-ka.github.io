We are happy to announce our next Science Spotlight titled `Science Spotlight: Medical Engineering`. This event will be hosted in conjunction with the kickoff for our local student paper contest.

We will host this event on **July 25th** at the FZI House of Living Labs **Haid-und-Neu-Stra√üe, 76131 Karlsruhe** starting at **16:00**.

We have a preliminary agenda assembled:

**Kick-Off Local Student Paper Contest**

We will start at 16:00 with a short introduction into the idea and the rules for the student paper contest.
If you are interested in participating in the student paper contest we recommend you attend this presentation and also you
can stay after the event and we will try to answer any open questions.


**FZI Presentations (Oliver Werthwein M.Sc. & Lara Schweickart M.Sc.)**

Following the kick-off of the local student paper contest we will have two short presentations about the medical engineering research conducted at FZI.
One presentation will cover the use of AI for analysis and assessment of physical exercises and another presentation will give as an introduction to virtual patient round and contactless recogniction of skin changes in the context of telemedicine.


**FZI House of Living Labs - Tour**

For an entertaining break in-between presentations we are happy that the FZI will give a tour through their House of Living Labs, showing more of their research in the field of medical engineering. This will include parts of the previously presented topics. We are excited to get a nice insight into the work at FZI House of Living Labs.


**Presentation by CEO of corvolution GmbH (Dr. Silvester Fuhrhop)**

Our presenter will give as an insight into the work done at the Start-Up corvolution on the topic of developing algorithms and sensor for long-term monitoring of a range of vital signs.


We will provide cold drinks and snacks for all participants and to allow for some cozy Get-Together after the presentations.
