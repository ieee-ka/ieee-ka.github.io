Some time has passed since our last Science Spotlight. Therefore we are delighted to host another event in cooperation with the IHE and Airbus. Alexander Hees and Grzegorz Adamiuk will focus on perspectives for all prospective electrical engineers in spaceborne radar system technologies.

This Science Spotlight will take place on the **1st of February 2024** at the **NTI lecture hall** starting at **15:45**.
We welcome all students, researchers and IEEE members that are interested in the topics. Will provide cold drinks and snacks during and after the event, so you will have the chance to chat with us and the speakers.
