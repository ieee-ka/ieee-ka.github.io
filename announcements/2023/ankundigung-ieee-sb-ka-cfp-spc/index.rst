We invite all KIT students to participate in this year's IEEE local student paper contest by submitting your undergraduate or graduate work by **October 6, 2023**. The event will not overlap with this year's signal intelligence challenge, but news on that is still pending.

The last months, we have further planned the prizes you can win, found most of the jury and grew more and more excited to have a look into our students' research. You can hand in your contribution via e-mail to `info@ieee-ka.de <mailto:info@ieee-ka.de>`_.
Have a look at the details on the `Event-Page <http://www.ieee-ka.de/events/student-paper-contest/>`_.
