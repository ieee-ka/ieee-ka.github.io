Some time has passed since our last Science Spotlight. Therefore we are delighted to host another event in cooperation with the Forschungszentrum Informatik (FZI). This time we will focus on the topic of Medical Engineering. We will explore several applications and research conducted at the FZI on this topic.

Additionally, we will kick-off this year's local student paper contest before we start with the presentations. This will include a short introduction to the idea of the local student paper contest and why you should submit your undergraduate or graduate work to the local student paper contest.

This Science Spotlight will take place on the **25th of July 2023** at the FZI House of Living Labs **Haid-und-Neu-Stra√üe 5A, 76131 Karlsruhe** starting at **16:00**.
We welcome all students, researchers and IEEE members that are interested in the topics. Will provide cold drinks and snacks during and after the event, so you will have the chance to chat with us and the speakers.

Please register `here <https://events.vtools.ieee.org/m/365913>`_ to allow for easier planning.

We will publish a detailed invitiation with the planned presentations and speakers soon!
