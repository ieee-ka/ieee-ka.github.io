We invite all student members to consider participating in the IEEEXtreme Programming Competition at its 17th installment.
IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members (advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch) compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems.
The Student Branch Karlsruhe will host any Teams from KIT that want to participate.

Details:

* Total description can be found on the `IEEEXtreme webpage <https://ieeextreme.org/>`_
* Teams consist of up to 3 IEEE Student or Graduate Student members, but can include a maximum of only 2 Graduate Student members
* **Date**: 25 October 2023, starting at 00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC 

If you would like to participate, please contact us so that venue arrangements can be made and a suitable proctor can be found.
